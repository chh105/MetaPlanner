MetaPlanner is an open source automated treatment planning method that performs meta-optimization of treatment planning hyperparameters. It is meant for educational/research purposes and supports planning in MatRad using one of their [experimental branches](https://github.com/e0404/matRad/tree/dev_VMAT).
